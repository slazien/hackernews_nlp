NLP on Hacker News data (work in progress)

This project aims to do large-scale data analysis of textual and graph data consisting of posts and comments on Hackernews.

*Current status*:

1. All posts and comments since the beginning of HN until July 2021 are included in a PostgreSQL database
2. Some basic data exploration code is included in a Jupyter notebook

*To do*:
1. Spectral clustering of users based on their post/comment content
2. HN-style natural language generation
3. Automatic post tagging based on Latent Dirichlet Allocation
4. Entity extraction
